# M-DTW : Multi-component Dynamic Time Warping

This is the final team project when I took the course ["Introduction to Interactive Audio Processing"](http://140.113.13.61/interactive/) last semester, 
which is based on one of the course lab work. 
In the course we use DTW to compare the similarity between two pitch sequence.
The restriction is that the pitch should be monophonic, so we though improving the system to adapt polyphonic pitch sequence would be a good topic.
